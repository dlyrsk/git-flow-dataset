### LSPosed

## Not Actively Maintained Projects
### Weex
[[big_company_backed_projects/weex/readme#|Weex]], a lightweight cross-platform mobile development tool developed by Alibaba, was retired from the Apache Incubator in May 2021.
The primary reason for the retirement was the lack of activity in the Weex projectâ€™s Project Management Committee (PPMC). The Apache Incubator initiated a vote on the Weex retirement process due to this inactivity.

Archived: Jun 3, 2021 (https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex)
Maybe related to *THE APACHE WAY* (https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/). Project continues on https://github.com/alibaba/weex but still not active.
Possible compare to other Apache incubator projects, or other projects by Alibaba.
